# Tutorial: LaTeX formatting
LaTeX formatting is a magic skill that some people have mastered to an awe-inducing level resulting in papers that look like pieces of art. 
Since I am working on improving my LaTeX skills, I want to share useful things I learn on my journey.

### This repository
In this repository, I will collect tipps and tricks for LaTeX formatting in the style of a living review.
At the moment, this tutorial covers the following topics:
- **Tables**: Formatting, how to align float values at the comma, how to color cells, how to import csv files and display the content (Added in July 2025)

I plan to include additional topics in the future.

### Versioning
LaTeX versions and their packages change constantly. I can't keep track of all changes and adapt my code quickly. If you find bugs, please leave an issue or create a pull request with an update!
